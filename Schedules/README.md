#### What is a Project:
- Endeavor to achieve a goal.
- Definite beginning and end.
- Has a budget.
- Terminology:
    - Scope.
    - Time.
    - Resources.
    - Quality.
    - Cost.
#### Project Schedule:
1. Includes what has to get done, by whom, and in what order.
2. Shows how the project parts fit together.
3. Shows how the project is performing.
4. Makes managing work easy.
5. Reflects changes and forecasts.
- Project Schedule Management:
    - Plan how to schedule the project. 
    - Define Tasks.
    - WBS: Work Breakdown Structure. 
    - After you identify activities put them in logical sequence.
    - Estimate resources to each activity.
    - Many techniques such as scrum.
    - Fine-tune a schedules again and again.
    - Compare the origional schedule with the resulted output for upcoming projects.
- Schedule Management Plan:
    - Choose a scheduling method:
        - Critical path.
        - Critical chain.
        - Scrum.
        - Kanban.
    - Choose a scheduling tool:
        - Mircosoft project.
    - Accuracy and measurements:
        - Estimates: +/- X%?
        - Work effort: hours, days, or weeks?
    - Update schedule:
        - People record their progress.
    - Schedule threshold. 
> With larger projects you will need to document everything you do to benefit from it later.

#### Schedule Details:
1. summary schedule.
2. Project schdule.
3. Detailed schedule.
- Identify Activities.
    - WBS:
        1. Make a list of high level deliverables.
        2. Look for lower level deliverables.
        3. Identify work required to be done (activities) and give each activity an ID.
        4. Ensure activities are on the right size (Estimate time and cost).
- Add Milestones.
    - Form Milestones at the beginning and end of the phase.
    - Helps you define progress.
- Can schedule by deliverable, phase, group.
#### Sequencing Activities:
1. Start with a rough estimate.
2. Midrange estimates.
3. Detailed estimates.
> Estimates forecast how long the project will take and what it will cost.
- Methods for estimating activities:
    - Use past performance.
    - Ask people who understand the work.
    - Ask Experts.
> Delphi Method. </br>
> PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Tecknique) => Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessemstic.
- Put Activities in Order:
    - Activities dependencies use a Network Diagram. or Gantt Chart.
- Identify the right order. 
- Linked activities: Predecessors and Successors.
- Determine start and finish date. (Finish to Start) => Most dependencies are Finish to Start.
- Handle Lag in dependencies.
- Problems with start-to-start Dependencies.
- Best Practices for Seqcuencing Activities:
1. Use finish-to-finish for most of the tasks.
2. Avoid start-to-start and start-to-finish links.
3. Use lag only to reflect passage of time.
4. Avoid negative lag.
5. Every activity should have at least one predecessor and one successor.
6. Don't link to summary tasks. 
7. Eliminate redundant links. 
8. Avoid date constraints.
> Hard Constraints. 
#### Assigning Resources to Tasks: 
- Resource Plan Identification:
    - Required skills.
    - Materials.
    - Equipment.
    - Facilities.
    - Travel.
- Procure resources.
- In-House resources. 
- Outside resources. 
- Labor Resources = Work Resources. 
- Project Cost.
- Building, Equipment and Facilities.
- Material Resources are tracked by quantity not time. 
- NoWork Resources: Permits, Travel ...
> Availability, Quantity,Cost => if assigned then go to activities.
- Duration:  Work/Resources => 8h work/1 resource unit. (100% for full time)
- Keep an assignment variable fixed. 
- Assign resources to activities. 
- Milestones don't have duration. l
> Work = Duration*Units.
- Replace generic resources with people. 
    - Ask about experience or productivity. 
    - Availability.
    - Allocation of project. 
- Working with Part-time workers and teams. 
- Working with remote teams. 
#### Fine-Tuning Assingments: 
- What is critical path?
- Determine Total Flow. 
- Lengthen, Delay assignment workload. 
- Adjust level of work over time. 
- Replace overallocated resources. 
- Optimize schedule.
    - Include schedule contingency time. 
- Baseline the schedule. 
#### Managing Schedule:
- Proactively manage a schedule. 
- Update progress in the schedule.
- Find schedule problems. 
- Fast-track to shorten a schedule.
- Pay more to shorten schedule: Crashing. 
    - Add more resources.
    - Critical path. 
    - Fewer tasks to crash. 
- Change the schedule to reduce cost. 
    - Look for cheaper resources.
- Reduce scope => cutting activities. 
- Improve schedules:
    1. Get training on building schedules.
    2. Institute quality reviews.
    3. Launch processes to collect accurate data.
    4. Leverage a project assistant.
