- Steps:
    - WBS. 
    - Compare the initial budget to sponsors expectations.
    - Refine the budget.
- Costing standards:
1. Internal cosing for the organization.
2. Preplanned resources budgeting.
3. The cost of people.
4. Accounting department costs.
> Cost per hour or numbers per hour.
- Enterprise Environmental Factors:
1. The culture of the organization (how)
2. Budgeting cycles.
3. Overall market conditions.

- Capital and Operating Costs:
1. Capital Costs: funds allocated for buying things to create future benefits in the organization. (CapEx)
2. Operating Costs: Utilities. (OpEx)
- Types of Estimating:
1. *ROM*: Rough Order of Magnitude. (minimal expectations)
2. Badgetary estimations. 15%-45% less or more.
3. Definitive estimations. -5%-10%.
- Estimation Approaches:
1. Ask experienced people.
2. Analogous estimating.
3. Parametric estimating.
4. Bottom-up estimating.
    - Trainglular approach:
    > (Optimistic+Most likely+Pessimistic)/3
    - Beta Distribution estimate:
    > (Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic)/6
- Establish an Estimating Structure:
1. Observe standard approaches typical to your industry.
2. Look for events in the project where finantial information updated. 
3. Refine estimate throughout the project lifecycle.
- Assign Costs to Resources.
1. Ensure the cost outlays are captured in the project schedule. 
2. Build a money chart forecast.
3. Group similar cost types together.
4. Double-check all of your costs for each task captured.
- Control Project by: 
1. Refineing the spending dates.
2. Track actual costs on the cost outlay chart.
- Finalize and Communicate your budget:

- Recover a Bloated Budget: 
    - Actual spending is way more forecast. 
- Earned Value Budget Tracking: 
    - Understand how much has the project earned. 
1. Planned Value (PV)
2. Earned Value (EV)
3. Actual Cost (AC)
- Collect Resource Usage Information: 
1. Determine People.
2. Determine Timing.
3. Consider Scheduling.
4. Don't underestimate the time it takes to collect necessary resources. 
- Select Budget Reporting Options:
    - Overtime.
    - Pay raises.
    - Contracts.
    - Create detailed report. 
    - Be consistent.
- Funding Limit Reconciliantion. 
- Apply Foresight to Budget Status. 
    - Think ahead to manage and control projects. 
    - Remember that not all tasks will be affected by change in staffing. 
    - Use a mix of three types of reports. 
- Address Budgeting Issues: 
    - Check Time periods of data.
    - Check purchases againset budget. 
    - Check cost codes assigned to the porject. 
        - Vendors.
        - Labor hours.
        - Project travel.
